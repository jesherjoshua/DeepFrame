# Supplementary Results

## Overview

This directory contains additional experiment results for the DeepFrame framework, focusing on datasets including Trashcan1.0, TrashcanExtended, and TrashcanExtended-4class. These results serve as supplementary proof for our experiments, expanding on the limitations of the paper due to space constraints.

### Experiment Datasets

1. **Trashcan1.0**: Original dataset used in the experiments.
2. **TrashcanExtended**: Extended dataset with additional images and augmentations.
3. **TrashcanExtended-4class**: Extended dataset with four categorized classes.

### Graphs

The directory includes additional graphs representing various metrics and performance indicators obtained from experiments on the mentioned datasets.
